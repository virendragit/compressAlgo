// Problem description
//
// characters are repeated and emitting a condensed description of those characters
//
// I'm not as interested in the right or wrong answer, I just want to see your thought process.  Talk through what you're thinking.
// I don't care about what language you use, or that you use correct syntax. It can even be pseudo code.
//
// Examples
// compress("AAAABBAA")    -> "4xAB2xA"
// compress("CCCCCC")   -> "6xC"
// compress("ABCD")     -> "ABCD"
// compress("4236")     -> "4236"
// compress("BBAACCDD") -> "2xB2xA2xC2xD"

// Implement the compression algorithm described above
